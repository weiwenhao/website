Nature is a programming language that aims for simplicity and elegance in its syntax, focusing on a pleasant coding and reading experience for its users.

At the language level, Nature has the following features:

- Type system with null safety, generics, and union types
- Static cross-compilation, allowing Nature source code to be compiled into executable files for the target machine without relying on any third-party components
- Progressive garbage collection, supporting both automatic and manual memory management
- Built-in data structures such as lists, maps, sets, and tuples
- Package and module management
- Function labels, closures, error handling, and coroutines
- Integration with SSA (Static Single Assignment) form, linear scan register allocation, reflection mechanism, assembler, and linker

As the standard library gradually improves, Nature can be applied in various domains such as game engine and game development, scientific and AI computing, operating systems, and IoT, with game engines being the primary focus for Nature 1.0+.

Nature is suitable for open-source creators, independent developers, as well as for learning and research purposes. We hope that Nature not only provides convenience in the language itself but also enables you to create enjoyable and interesting projects using Nature.


## ðŸ«§ FAQ

1.Why are the types of variables and function parameters placed before their names, while the return type of functions is placed after?

Explanation about the position of types: [https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/issues/7](https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/issues/7)

2.What is the meaning of the logo?

The logo represents a starship, named "Natural Selection," from the novel "The Three-Body Problem."

3.Why do the language keywords include emojis?

Yes, because mojo.ðŸ”¥ did it first. Emojis as keywords will continue to be a feature of Nature, and future versions of the language will also try to use emojis as syntactic sugar whenever possible. The goal is to bring a light-hearted feeling to coding with emojis.
