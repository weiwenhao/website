The currently supported operators are as follows:

:::tip
Due to the large number of integer data types, in order to represent them uniformly, the term "integer" will be used in the following documentation to refer to the integer types, "float" will be used for floating-point types, and "number" will be used to encompass both types.
:::

Here are some important details to note:

- Operators associate according to their precedence and are evaluated from left to right when they have the same precedence.
- Binary operators (operators that take two operands) currently only support the number type. However, support for the + and == operators with string types will be added in the future.
- Bitwise operators only work with the integer type.
