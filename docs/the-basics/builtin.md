Built-in functions are globally accessible and do not need to be imported. They are generally declared in the `builtin_temp.n` file.

## print/println

Definition:

```nature
fn print(...[any] args) {}

fn println(...[any] args) {}
```

Only bool/string/number types are supported for printing. Compared to `print`, `println` adds a newline character `\n` and separates each argument with a space.

Example:

```nature
println("hello", true, "world")

// output:
// > hello true world
// >
```

## errort

Definition:

```nature
type tracet = struct {
    string path
    string ident
    int line
    int column
}

type errort = struct {
    string msg
    [tracet] traces
    bool has
}
```

We have already encountered this structure in the error-handling section.

## sizeof

```nature
int len = sizeof(int) // 8
int len = sizeof(f32) // 4
```

`sizeof` is not a built-in function per se because its argument is a type. You can think of `sizeof` as a built-in macro. Essentially, it is equivalent to writing `sizeof int`.
