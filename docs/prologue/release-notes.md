The nature version numbers follow the principles of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), where versions 0.1 to 1.0 consist of two parts.

The upper part always carries the beta identifier, indicating that it is not production-ready.

The lower part contains stable and backward-compatible syntax and APIs, and at this point, nature can be used for personal independent/open-source projects but does not offer LTS versions.

When version 1.0 is released, nature will be officially used for open-source/commercial projects and will have LTS versions.

### Changelog

Release history: [https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/releases](https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/releases)

Current version: v0.3.0-beta

Release date: 2023-08

Features

1. Package management tool `npkg` #10
2. Cross-platform compilation based on file names, such as `main.linux.n`
3. Support for string symbol escaping, e.g., `var str = 'hello\nworld'`
4. Support for coercing strings to `[u8]` and vice versa
5. Support for concatenating characters using the `+` operator and logical comparison between strings
6. Declaration of hexadecimal literal numbers, e.g., `var i = 0x1A`
7. New standard library `syscall` for interacting with the operating system
8. New standard library `libc` for interacting with C language
9. Declaration of an empty list's type and length through type coercion, e.g., `var list = [] as [u8,5]`
10. Maps and sets also support type declarations through empty value type coercion, e.g., `var set = {} as {int}`
11. New built-in type `cptr`, equivalent to C language's `void*`, commonly used for interacting with C language/OS
12. String and list types have a new chained method `raw()`, which directly accesses the raw data in the heap

Changed

1. Changed for-loop iterator for lists from `k` to `v`, e.g., `for v in list`
2. Errors generated by `try` no longer check for duplicate receiving variables
3. Support for function return values of type `void_expr()`
4. Fixed an issue with the assembler's `jmp rel8` instruction
