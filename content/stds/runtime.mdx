Okay, here is the professional English translation of the provided document about the `runtime` module:

# runtime

## Overview
The `runtime` standard library provides low-level runtime-related operations, including functionalities for vectors (`vec`), sets (`set`), maps (`map`), string operations, and garbage collection.

## Functions

### processor_index
Gets the processor index in the GMP model.

```nature
fn processor_index():int
```

### gc
Forces garbage collection.

```nature
fn gc()
```

### malloc_bytes
Gets the number of allocated memory bytes.

```nature
fn malloc_bytes():i64
```

## Usage Example

```nature
import runtime

fn main() {
    // Force garbage collection
    runtime.gc()

    // Processor index in the GMP model
    var idx = runtime.processor_index()
}
```

## Notes
1. Most functions in the `runtime` standard library are low-level operations and should be used with caution.
2. Garbage collection (`gc`) is usually performed automatically by the system; manual invocation is only required in special cases.
