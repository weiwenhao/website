# process

The `process` library provides functionalities for creating and managing child processes, allowing the execution of external commands and interaction with them.

## Type Definitions

### `state_t`

Struct used to store state information after process execution completes.

```nature
type state_t = struct{
    string stdout    // Process's standard output content
    string stderr    // Process's standard error output content
    i32 exit_code // Process's exit code
    i32 term_sig  // The signal that caused the process to terminate (if applicable)
}
```

### `process_t`

Struct representing a running or exited child process.

```nature
type process_t = struct{
    int pid          // Process ID
    anyptr args      // Internal arguments pointer (implementation details)
    anyptr envs      // Internal environment variables pointer (implementation details)
    anyptr p         // Internal process handle pointer (implementation details)
    anyptr co        // Associated coroutine pointer (implementation details)
    bool exited      // Whether the process has exited
    i32 exit_code // Process exit code (if exited is true)
    i32 term_sig  // Signal that caused process termination (if applicable)
    command_t cmd    // The command_t object used to create this process
}
```

### `command_t`

Struct used to configure and prepare an external command for execution.

```nature
type command_t = struct{
    string name      // Name of the command or program to be executed
    [string] args    // List of arguments passed to the command

    string cwd       // Command's working directory (optional, defaults to current directory)
    [string] env     // List of environment variables (optional, defaults to inheriting parent process environment)

    io.reader stdin  // Process's standard input stream
    io.writer stdout // Process's standard output stream
    io.writer stderr // Process's standard error output stream
}
```

## Functions

### `run(string name, [string] args):ptr<state_t>!`

Convenience function for executing a command and waiting for it to complete, then returning a `state_t` containing its output and status.

* `name`: Name of the command to be executed.
* `args`: List of arguments passed to the command.
* Internally creates `io.buffer` to capture standard output and standard error.
* Returns a pointer to a `state_t`, containing `stdout`, `stderr`, `exit_code`, and `term_sig`. If execution fails, returns an error.

### `command(string name, [string] args):ptr<command_t>!`

Creates a `command_t` object for more fine-grained configuration and launching of a process.

* `name`: Name of the command to be executed.
* `args`: List of arguments passed to the command.
* Defaults `stdin` to `fs.discard()` (discards input), `stdout` to `fs.stdout()` (parent process standard output), and `stderr` to `fs.stderr()` (parent process standard error). You can modify these fields later.
* Returns a pointer to a `command_t` object.

## command_t Methods

### `command_t.spawn():ptr<process_t>!`

Launches a new child process according to the `command_t` configuration, but does not wait for it to complete.

* Internally calls `uv_spawn` to create the process.
* Asynchronously launches coroutines to handle the child process's standard output and standard error streams and writes them to the `stdout` and `stderr` writers configured in the `command_t`.
* Returns a pointer to a `process_t` object, representing the newly launched process. If launch fails, returns an error.

## process_t Methods

### `process_t.wait():void!`

Blocks the current coroutine until the associated child process exits.

* This method waits for the process execution to complete and updates the `exited`, `exit_code`, and `term_sig` fields in the `process_t` struct.

### `process_t.read_stdout():string!`

Reads data from the child process's standard output pipe.

* This is a blocking operation, waiting until data is available or the pipe is closed.
* Returns the read string data. Returns an error if the pipe is closed or an error occurs.
* Note: This method is typically not called directly; instead, output is handled by configuring `command_t.stdout`.

### `process_t.read_stderr():string!`

Reads data from the child process's standard error pipe.

* This is a blocking operation, waiting until data is available or the pipe is closed.
* Returns the read string data. Returns an error if the pipe is closed or an error occurs.
* Note: This method is typically not called directly; instead, output is handled by configuring `command_t.stderr`.

## Usage Example

```nature
import process
import io

fn main():void! {
    var cmd = process.command('echo', ['hello world'])
    var p = cmd.spawn()
    p.wait()
    println('process exited')
}
```

Custom buf (Example using `io.buffer`, unrelated to `process` execution flow)

```nature
import io

fn main():void! {
    var buf = io.buffer{}
    var n = buf.write('hello world' as [u8])
    println('write 1:', n, buf.empty(), buf.len(), buf.cap())

    n = buf.write('This is an arbitrary text written to the buffer' as [u8])
    println('write 2:', n, buf.empty(), buf.len(), buf.cap())

    var read_buf = vec_new<u8>(0, 5)
    n = buf.read(read_buf)
    println('read 1:', n, read_buf as string, buf.empty(), buf.len(), buf.cap())


    var remain_buf = buf.read_all()
    println('read 2:', remain_buf as string, buf.empty(), buf.len(), buf.cap())
}
```
