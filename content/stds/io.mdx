Okay, here is the professional English translation of the provided document about the `io` module:

# io

The `io` library defines basic I/O interfaces and implementations, including memory buffers and buffered readers.

## Interfaces

### `reader`

Represents a source from which data can be read.

```
type reader = interface{
    fn read([u8] buf):int! // Reads data from the source into buf, returns the number of bytes read. Returns an error on failure.
}
```

### `writer`

Represents a target to which data can be written.

```
type writer = interface{
    fn write([u8] buf):int! // Writes the data in buf to the target, returns the number of bytes written. Returns an error on failure.
}
```

### `seeker`

Represents an I/O object that supports setting the read/write position.

```
type seeker = interface{
    fn seek(int offset, int whence):int! // Sets the offset, returns the new absolute offset. Returns an error on failure.
}
```

## `buffer` Type

`buffer` is a variable-sized memory byte buffer that implements the `reader` and `writer` interfaces.

```
type buffer: reader, writer = struct{
    [u8] buf   // Underlying byte slice for storing data
    int offset // Offset of the current read position
}
```

### `buffer.write([u8] buf):int!`

Appends the content of `buf` to the end of the buffer.
Returns the number of bytes written (i.e., the length of `buf`).

### `buffer.read([u8] buf):int!`

Reads data from the buffer into `buf`. The read operation advances the internal read offset `offset`.
If the buffer is empty (`empty()` is `true`), it will reset the buffer and return an 'EOF' error (unless `buf` length is 0).
Returns the number of bytes actually read.

### `buffer.empty():bool`

Checks if the buffer has no unread data (i.e., if `offset` is greater than or equal to the length of `buf`).

### `buffer.len():int`

Returns the number of bytes of unread data in the buffer (`buf.len() - offset`).

### `buffer.cap():int`

Returns the capacity of the underlying byte slice.

### `buffer.truncate(int n):void!`

Discards all data in the buffer except for the first `n` unread bytes.
If `n` is 0, it is equivalent to `reset()`.
If `n` is less than 0 or greater than `len()`, it will cause a panic.

### `buffer.reset():void!`

Resets the buffer, making it empty, but retains the underlying allocated storage for future writes. `offset` is set to 0, and `buf` length is set to 0.

### `buffer.read_all():[u8]!`

Reads and returns all unread data in the buffer, then resets the buffer.
If the buffer is empty, returns an empty slice.

## `buf_reader<T: reader>` Type

`buf_reader` provides buffering for another `reader` object `rd`. It implements the `reader` interface.

```
type buf_reader<T: reader>: reader = struct{
    T rd           // The underlying reader
    [u8] buf       // Internal buffer, defaults to 4096 bytes
    int r          // Buffer read position
    int w          // Buffer write position
    bool eof       // Whether the end of the underlying reader has been reached
}
```

### `buf_reader<T>.size():int`

Returns the size (capacity) of the internal buffer.

### `buf_reader<T>.reset(T rd)`

Resets the `buf_reader` to use the new underlying `reader` `rd`, and discards all buffered data, resetting all state.

### `buf_reader<T>.fill():void!` (Internal method)

Reads new data from the underlying `reader` to fill the buffer. It will first move the unread data in the buffer to the beginning, then attempt to read data from `rd` to fill the remaining space.
If multiple read attempts (default 100 times) fail to read new data, a 'no progress' error will be returned.
If 'EOF' is encountered during reading, the `eof` flag will be set to `true`.
Marked as `#local`, typically not called directly.

### `buf_reader<T>.read([u8] buf):int!`

Reads data from the buffer or the underlying `reader` into `buf`.
If `buf` is empty and the buffer has data, returns 0. If `buf` is empty and the buffer is empty, sets `eof` and returns 'EOF'.
If the buffer is empty, it will attempt to read from the underlying `reader`. If the requested `buf` size is not less than the internal buffer size, it reads directly from `rd` into `buf` to avoid copying. Otherwise, it first calls `fill()` to populate the internal buffer.
Then copies data from the internal buffer to `buf`.
Returns the number of bytes read. If the end of the underlying `reader` is reached, the `eof` flag will be set, and subsequent reads will return an 'EOF' error.

### `buf_reader<T>.buffered():int`

Returns the number of bytes currently readable in the internal buffer (`w - r`).

### `buf_reader<T>.read_until(u8 delim):[u8]`

Reads until the first `delim` separator is encountered, returning the data slice including the separator.
If the separator is not found before the buffer is full or a read error (including EOF) is encountered, it returns all unread data currently in the buffer.
The read operation consumes data from the buffer.

### `buf_reader<T>.read_exact([u8] buf):void!`

Reads exactly `buf.len()` bytes of data to fill `buf`.
Continues calling `read` until `buf` is completely filled. If an error (including EOF) is encountered before filling, an error will be returned.

### `buf_reader<T>.read_byte():u8!`

Reads and returns a single byte.
If the buffer is empty, it will attempt to call `fill()`. If it cannot read (e.g., EOF), an error will be returned.

### `buf_reader<T>.read_line():string!`

Reads a line of data, where the line ending can be `\n` or `\r\n`. The returned string does not include the line ending marker.
If EOF has been reached, an 'EOF' error will be returned.
Implemented internally using `read_until('\n')`.
