# Get Started

## Features

- Lightweight, concise, and consistent syntax design, easy to master and get started quickly
- Strong type system, static analysis and compilation, memory safety, exception handling, making it easy to write secure and reliable software
- Built-in concurrency primitives: go/future/channel/select
- Compiles directly to machine code for the target platform, does not rely on LLVM, and supports cross-compilation.
- Simple deployment, efficient compilation, static linking based on musl libc with good cross-platform characteristics
- Comprehensive type system supporting generics, union types, interfaces, nullable(?), errable(!)
- High-performance GC implementation with very short STW (Stop The World)
- High-performance memory allocator implementation, referencing tcmalloc
- High-performance shared-stack coroutine implementation, capable of millions of coroutine switches per second
- High-performance IO based on libuv implementation
- High-performance runtime and compiler based on pure C implementation
- Built-in data structures vec/map/set/tup and common standard library implementations
- Function calls follow system ABI, built-in libc, c std functions are called without performance loss.
- Centralized package management system npkg
- Editor LSP support

## Overview

The nature programming language has reached an early usable version, with a basically stable syntax API that will not change significantly before version 1.0. Future versions will add some necessary and commonly used syntax features such as enum, ternary operators, struct labels, etc.

Key features to be completed include controllable memory allocator, LLM coding adaptation, DSL test framework, GUI adaptation, and WASM3.0 adaptation.

The current version supports compilation for the following target architectures: linux_amd64, linux_arm64, linux_riscv64, darwin_amd64, darwin_arm64. 

Nature includes a set of test cases and standard libraries to test the usability of basic functionality and syntax, includes a set of small to medium-sized projects to test overall usability, but has not yet been tested in large-scale projects.

## Installation

1️⃣ Download the binary package suitable for your system from [https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/releases](https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/releases) and extract it.

2️⃣ Move the nature folder to the `/usr/local` directory. If you need to install nature in another directory, please manually set the NATURE_ROOT environment variable to point to the nature directory.

```sh
/usr/local/nature/
├── LICENSE-APACHE
├── LICENSE-MIT
├── VERSION
├── bin
├── lib
└── std
```

3️⃣ Add the `/usr/local/nature/bin` directory to your system environment variables, for example `cat ~/.zshrc`

```sh
...
export PATH="/usr/local/nature/bin:$PATH"
...
```

4️⃣ Run the command `nature --version` to check the current version

```sh
> nature --version
nature vx.x.x - release build 1970-01-01
```

5️⃣ Run the command `nature -h` to view help

```sh
> nature -h
Nature Programming Language Compiler vx.x.x

Usage:
  nature [command] [flags] [arguments]
...
```

## Hello World

Create a main.n file

```nature  
import fmt  
  
fn main() {  
    fmt.printf('hello nature')
}  
```

Compile and run the binary file main

```sh
> nature build main.n && ./main
hello nature
```

Specify compilation target platform and architecture

```sh
> nature build --target darwin_amd64 main.n
```

Specify output binary file name as hello

```sh
> nature build -o hello main.n
```

## Editor Support

The LSP server `nls` is already installed with the nature installation package in the /usr/local/nature/bin directory.

```sh
ls -lh /usr/local/nature/bin
total 44696
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel   764K Feb 24 13:18 nature
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel   6.1M Feb 24 13:20 nls
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel    15M Feb 24 13:20 npkg
```

Search for "nature language" in the VSCode extension marketplace to download the LSP client and start using it.
