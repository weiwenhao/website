# Get Started

## Introduction

Nature is a general-purpose open source programming language and compiler that aspires to provide developers with a **simple and elegant** development experience that can **simply and efficiently** build secure and reliable cross-platform software.

## Features 
  
- ✓ Simple, natural, and consistent syntax design
- ✓ No dependency on llvm and VM, compiles directly to target platform machine code and supports cross-compilation.
- ✓ Simple deployment, purely static linking based on musl libc, no additional dependencies, good cross-platform characteristics
- ✓ Comprehensive type system with support for generics, union types, interfaces, null-value safety, etc.
- ✓ High-performance GC implementation with a very short STW (Stop The World)
- ✓ High-performance shared-stack concatenation implementation, capable of millions of concatenation switches per second
- ✓ Built-in libuv to handle IO event loops in collaboration with the concatenators  
- ✓ High-performance runtime and compiler based on a pure C implementation
- ✓ Modularity and package management system npkg
- ✓ Built-in implementations of common data structures and standard libraries.
- ✓ Use try+catch for error handling, match for pattern matching, channel for concurrent communication, select for concurrent processing.
- ✓ Follow the system ABI, built-in libc, you can directly call the C language standard library functions to accelerate code development
- ✓ editor lsp support
- ✓ Asymptotic GC for manual memory management.  
- ○ Test DSL, efficient and stable utilization of AI code.  
- ○ macho cross-platform linker (lack of macho linker currently prevents cross-compilation on darwin platform)
- ○ Collaborative scheduling system  
- ○ Cross-platform compilation support for wasm and risc64 platforms.  
- ○ Compile to readable golang programming language.


## Project Overview 

The nature programming language has reached a usable version, and the syntax APIs are basically stable, there will not be any drastic changes before version 1.0, but there are some minor syntax changes.

The current version of nature source code supports compilation on the following target platforms 
- linux/amd64 
- linux/arm64 
- darwin/amd64 
- darwin/arm64 
  
nature includes a set of test cases and a standard library to test the usability of the syntax, but it has not been tested on a medium to large scale project, and so there are still many bugs. 

Major work in the next versions of The main work is 
- Standard library refinement 
- Gathering user feedback 
- Project validation and bug fixes 
- Refinement of language features 

## Design Philosophy

golang is the programming language I work with. It has a simple syntax, a very good and high-performance cross-platform compiler and runtime implementation, an advanced concurrent design style and high-performance network I/O, as well as good support for standard libraries. However, there are some inconveniences.

- Syntax is too simple, leading to lack of expressiveness.
- Type system is not perfect, lack of nullable, enum parameters, generic (now available), etc.
- Error handling is cumbersome.
- Automatic GC and preemptive scheduling are excellent, but they limit the scope of golang.

nature is designed to be a continuation and optimization of the golang programming language, and pursues certain differences, as described in the Features section.

Based on the existing features of the nature programming language, it is suitable for game engines and game development, scientific computing and AI, OS and IoT, and web development.


## Suggestions for Use

As an early programming language, it is currently suitable for the following types of developers
1. technology explorers
    - Developers who are curious about new technologies
    - Developers who are curious about new technologies, willing to try new things, and able to live with the bugs that existed in earlier versions.
    - Interested in participating in discussions about language design and improvement.

2. language developers and researchers
    - Developers interested in programming language design and implementation.
    - Researchers in compilation principles
    - Learners who want to learn how to implement a programming language.

3. Feedback Contributors
    - Developers who are willing to provide feedback on their use of the language.
    - Developers who are willing to provide feedback on their use of the language.
    - Interested in contributing to projects and standards library improvements

Not applicable to the following types of developers

1. enterprise users who need to use in production environment
2. project developers who require high stability.
3. Programming beginners
4. developers who need a lot of third-party library support


## Installation

1️⃣ Download the binary zip for your system at [https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/releases](https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/releases) and extract it.


2️⃣ Move the nature folder to the `/usr/local` directory. If you need to install nature in another directory, manually set the NATURE_ROOT environment variable to point to the nature directory.

```sh
/usr/local/nature/
├── LICENSE-APACHE
├── LICENSE-MIT
├── VERSION
├── bin
├── lib
└── std
└── std
```

3️⃣ Add the `/usr/local/nature/bin` directory to the system environment variables, e.g. `cat ~/.zshrc`

```sh
...
export PATH="/usr/local/nature/bin:$PATH"
...
```

4️⃣ Run the command `nature --version` to view the current version

```sh
> nature --version
nature v0.5.0-beta - release build 2025-02-22
```

5️⃣ Run the command `nature -h` to see the available commands

```bash
> nature -h
Nature Programming Language Compiler vx.x.x

Usage.
  nature [command] [flags] [arguments]
...
```

## Hello Nature

Create the main.n file

```nature
import fmt

fn main() {
    fmt.printf('hello nature')
}
```

Compile and run the binary main

```sh
> nature build main.n && . /main
hello nature
```

Specify the target platform and architecture

```sh
> nature build --target darwin_amd64 main.n
```

Specify that the output binary is called hello

```sh
> nature build -o hello main.n
```

## Example project
