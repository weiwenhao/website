# Get Started

## Introduction

Nature is a general-purpose open source programming language and compiler that aspires to provide developers with a **simple and elegant** development experience that can **simply and efficiently** build secure and reliable cross-platform software.

## Features 
  
- ✓ Simple, natural, consistent syntax design, even programming beginners can easily grasp, quickly get started!
- ✓ No dependency on llvm and VM, compiles directly to target platform machine code and supports cross-compilation.
- ✓ Simple deployment, purely static linking based on musl libc, no additional dependencies, good cross-platform characteristics
- ✓ Comprehensive type system with support for generics, union types, interfaces, null-value safety, etc.
- ✓ High-performance GC implementation with a very short STW (Stop The World)
- ✓ High-performance shared-stack Coroutine implementation, capable of millions of Coroutine switches per second
- ✓ Built-in libuv to handle IO event loops in collaboration with the concatenators  
- ✓ High-performance runtime and compiler based on a pure C implementation
- ✓ Modularity and package management system npkg
- ✓ Built-in implementations of common data structures and standard libraries.
- ✓ Use try+catch for error handling, match for pattern matching, channel for concurrent communication, select for concurrent processing.
- ✓ Follow the system ABI, built-in libc, you can directly call the C language standard library functions to accelerate code development
- ✓ editor lsp support
- ✓ Asymptotic GC for manual memory management.  
- ○ Test DSL, efficient and stable utilization of AI code.  
- ○ macho cross-platform linker (lack of macho linker currently prevents cross-compilation on darwin platform)
- ○ Collaborative scheduling system  
- ○ Cross-platform compilation support for wasm and risc64 platforms.  
- ○ Compile to readable golang programming language.


## Project Overview

The nature programming language has reached an early usable version, and the syntax API is basically stable and will not change significantly before version 1.0.

The current version of nature source code supports compilation on the following target platforms
- linux/amd64
- linux/arm64
- darwin/amd64
- darwin/arm64

nature includes a set of test cases and standard libraries to test the usability of basic functionality and syntax, and a small set of projects to test overall usability, but has not yet been tested in medium to large scale projects.

The core work to follow will be to improve the usability of the nature programming language, including standard library refinement, user feedback collection, and bug fixes.
  
## Design Philosophy

Golang is the programming language I use at work. Its syntax is simple, and it boasts an excellent, high-performance cross-platform compiler and runtime implementation. It features an advanced coroutine design style, high-performance network I/O, and comprehensive standard library support. However, there are also some inconveniences:

- The overly simple syntax leads to insufficient expressive power
- The type system is not perfect, lacking features such as nullable types, enum parameters, and generics (which are now available)
- The error handling mechanism is cumbersome
- Although the design of automatic GC and preemptive scheduling is excellent, it also limits the application scope of golang

The design philosophy of nature is a continuation and optimization of the golang programming language, while also pursuing certain differences, as described in the features section. Based on the current features of the nature programming language, it is suitable for fields such as game engines and game development, scientific computing and AI, operating systems and IoT, as well as web development.

## Recommendations for Use

As an early programming language, it is currently suitable for the following types of developers

- Technical explorers - people who are willing to try new things, are comfortable with the bugs that existed in earlier versions, and are interested in participating in discussions about language design and improvement.
- Language developers and researchers - developers interested in programming language design and implementation, learning about compilation principles, and learning how to implement a programming language.
- Feedback Contributors - developers who are willing to provide feedback on their use of the language, are able to submit bug reports and suggestions for improvements, and are interested in participating in the project and in improving the standard library.

Not for the following types of developers
- Enterprise users who need to use the language in production environments
- Project developers with high stability requirements
- Beginners looking for a programming related job
- Developers who need a lot of third-party library support


## Installation

1️⃣ Download the binary zip for your system at [https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/releases](https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/releases) and extract it.


2️⃣ Move the nature folder to the `/usr/local` directory. If you need to install nature in another directory, manually set the NATURE_ROOT environment variable to point to the nature directory.

```sh
/usr/local/nature/
├── LICENSE-APACHE
├── LICENSE-MIT
├── VERSION
├── bin
├── lib
└── std
└── std
```

3️⃣ Add the `/usr/local/nature/bin` directory to the system environment variables, e.g. `cat ~/.zshrc`

```sh
...
export PATH="/usr/local/nature/bin:$PATH"
...
```

4️⃣ Run the command `nature --version` to view the current version

```sh
> nature --version
nature v0.5.0-beta - release build 2025-02-22
```

5️⃣ Run the command `nature -h` to see the available commands

```bash
> nature -h
Nature Programming Language Compiler vx.x.x

Usage.
  nature [command] [flags] [arguments]
...
```

## Hello Nature

Create the main.n file

```nature
import fmt

fn main() {
    fmt.printf('hello nature')
}
```

Compile and run the binary main

```sh
> nature build main.n && . /main
hello nature
```

Specify the target platform and architecture

```sh
> nature build --target darwin_amd64 main.n
```

Specify that the output binary is called hello

```sh
> nature build -o hello main.n
```

## Example project

## Editor support

The lsp server `nls` has been installed in the /usr/local/nature/bin directory along with the nature installer.

``` sh
ls -lh /usr/local/nature/bin
total 44696
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 root wheel 764K Feb 24 13:18 nature
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 root wheel 6.1M Feb 24 13:20 nls
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 root wheel 15M Feb 24 13:20 npkg
```
