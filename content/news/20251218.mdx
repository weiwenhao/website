title: "Nature 0.7 released, First Performance Optimizations Completed"
date: 2025-12-18
---

Nature v0.7 has achieved significant performance improvements through systematic optimizations of core modules including TCP/UDP/HTTP, CPU, string, GC, and closure. In benchmark tests, nature demonstrated unexpectedly strong performance, and there is still room for further optimization.

### Installation Package

https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/releases/tag/v0.7.0

### What's Changed
- Closure implementation refactored, JIT mode closure removed
- GC cleanup logic optimized, added needzero to distinguish whether a span needs cleanup
- String constantization handling, string as vec will perform deep copy
- HTTP server connection pool added
- Memory allocator performance optimized
- libuv usage refactored, removed multi-threading loop, using global loop
- TCP library performance optimized, connection pool added
- UDP removed libuv API, implemented using C API
- LIR BCC instruction assembly implementation optimized
- LIR safepoint instruction assembly implementation optimized, based on global flag to determine if GC is needed
- LIR stack instruction assembly implementation optimized, using sp register instead of fp register
- arm64/riscv64 added temporary variable elimination based on MOV instruction
- Struct instantiation method changed, assignment symbol from `=` to `:` https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/issues/174
- Editor NLS module development experience optimized, added language configuration files, struct completion, auto import, module suggestions, etc. https://github.com/nature-lang/nature/pull/178
